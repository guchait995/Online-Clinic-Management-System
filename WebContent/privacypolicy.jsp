   <h2>4.Cookies:</h2>
   <div align="center"><h3>"Cookies" are small computer files that are transferred to your computer's hard drive that contain information such as user ID, user preferences, lists of pages visited and activities conducted while browsing the Site. At your option, expense and responsibility, you may block cookies or delete cookies from your hard drive. However, by disabling cookies, you may not have access to the entire set of features of the Site.

<p>Generally, we use "cookies" to customize your experience on our Site and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site.</p>

<p>In addition, our business partners may use cookies to provide us with anonymous data and information regarding the use of our Site. Specifically, some of our business partners use cookies to show Dimension Healthcare ads on other sites on the internet as a result of you using the Site. Such cookies do not contain any Personal Information. You may opt out of receiving cookies placed by such third party vendors by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page.</p>

<p>Other cookies used by our business partners may collect other non-personally identifying information, such as the computer's IP address, type of operating system, type of internet browsing software, what web pages were viewed at what time, the geographic location of your internet service provider and demographic information, such as gender and age range. This information is used to provide Dimension Healthcare with more information about our user's demographics and internet behaviors. You may find out more about the information collected and how to opt-out of receiving these cookies by visiting our partner's website.</p>

<h2>5.Web Beacons:</h2>
<div align="center"><h3>In limited circumstances we also may use "Web Beacons" to collect anonymous, non-personal information about your use of our Site and the sites of selected sponsors and advertisers, and your use of emails, special promotions or newsletters we send to you. "Web Beacons" are tiny graphic image files imbedded in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to its home server information from the user's browser. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using the Site and selected sponsors' and advertisers' sites, or opening our emails, and for what purposes.</h3></div>
<h2>6.Website Analytics:</h2>
<div align="center"><h3>We may use third party website analytics services in connection with the Site. These website analytics services do not collect Personal Information that you do not voluntarily enter into the Site.

We are using the information collected from these services to find usability problems to make the Site easier to use. The recordings will never identify you or your account.</h3></div>
<h2>7.Storage:</h2>
<div align="center"><h3>We store all Traffic Data and review postings indefinitely, even after "deletion," and may archive such information elsewhere.

<div align="center"><h3>We may use your Personal Information to recommend certain resources or medical providers. We may use your Contact Data to send you information about Dimension Healthcare or our products or Services, to contact you when necessary, including to remind you of upcoming or follow-up appointments, and in conjunction with your use of certain Interactive Tools. We may use your Demographic Data, your Traffic Data, your Insurance Data or your Medical Data to customize and tailor your experience on the Site, in emails and in other communications, displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences. You agree that Dimension Healthcare may use Personal Information to allow your doctors to make appointments with other doctors on your behalf through the Services. We may also use your de-identified Personal Information to run (or authorize third parties to run) statistical research on individual or aggregate health or medical trends. Such research would only use your Personal Information in an anonymous manner that cannot be tied directly back to you.</h3></div>
<h2>9.Sharing of Information:</h2>

<p>We share Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Site and/or by making certain Interactive Tools available to our users. Those business partners shall be bound to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to Dimension Healthcare and to provide your requested medical care and services.</p>

<p>We may transfer information about you to another company in connection with a merger, sale or acquisition by or of Dimension Healthcare. In this event, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Dimension Healthcare does not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Information with any third parties for their promotional purposes.</p></h3></div>

<div align="center"><h3>You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and use much of the Site; however you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Site that require your Personal Information.</h3></div>
<h2>11.Confidentiality and Security:</h2>
<div align="center"><h3>Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless we believe in good faith that disclosure of your Personal Information or any other information we collect about you is necessary to: (1) comply with a court order or other legal process; (2) protect the rights, property or safety of Dimension Healthcare or another party; (3) enforce our Terms of Use; or (4) respond to claims that any posting or other content violates the rights of third-parties.</h3></div>

What you have written may be seen and/or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict.</h3></div>
<h2>14.Security:</h2>
<div align="center"><h3>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information on our Site, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

<p>Although we make good faith efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not open to the public, you should understand that there is no such thing as complete security, and we do not guarantee that there will be no unintended disclosures of your Personal Information. If we become aware that your Personal Information has been disclosed in a manner not in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you of the nature and extent of the disclosure (to the extent we know that information) as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law.</p></h3></div>
<h2>15.Lost or Stolen Information:</h2>
<div align="center"><h3>You must promptly notify us if your Contact Data is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that Contact Data from your account and update our records accordingly.

<p>We reserve the right, at any time, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy so please review it frequently. If we do, then we will notify you here, as well as by posting a notice on our Site and, where appropriate, a link to the modified policy so that you can review it.
